 In order to render PCL to EMF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-pdf) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert PCL file to EMF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load PCL file with an instance of Document class
1. Create & set EmfDevice class object with Size & Resolution 
1. Call EmfDevice.process method with page index & output file path

 Before running the Java conversion example code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.PDF for Java directly from Maven.

```cs
// load PCL with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("template.pcl");

// create an object of EmfDevice
PngDevice renderer = new EmfDevice();

// convert first of a particular PDF page to EMF format
renderer.process(document.getPages().get_Item(1), "output.emf");

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PCL" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/pcl/" >}}

PCL stands for Printer Command Language which is a Page Description Language introduced by Hewlett Packard (HP). HP created PCL to provide an efficient way for controlling printer features across many different printing devices. The format was originally developed for HP's dot matrix and Inkjet printers, but has been part of various thermal, matrix and page printers with the passage of time. The format underwent several different revisions, resulting in different versions where each version was enhanced to meet the demands of time with respect to the printer control features. Today, PCL is the most widely spread printer language in the laster printer market.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
