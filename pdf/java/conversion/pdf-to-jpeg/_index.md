 In order to render PDF to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.PDF for Java](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-pdf) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert PDF file to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load PDF file with an instance of Document class
1.  Create & set JpegDevice class object with Size & Resolution
1.  Call JpegDevice.process method with page index & output file path

 Before running the Java conversion example code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.PDF for Java directly from Maven.

```cs
// load PDF with an instance of Document
Document document = new Document("template.pdf");

// create an object of JpegDevice
PngDevice renderer = new JpegDevice();

// convert first of a particular PDF page to JPEG format
renderer.process(document.getPages().get_Item(1), "output.jpeg");

 Aspose.PDF API can be used for PDF document manipulation and parsing within applications. One can create, modify, compress, secure, print or save PDF to TXT, HTML, PCL, XFA, XML, XPS, EPUB, TEX, Images and more formats. Aspose.PDF is a standalone API and it does not depend on any software including Adobe Acrobat. ‎

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
