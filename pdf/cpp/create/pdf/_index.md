 Creating Adobe Acrobat PDF file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create PDF documents from scratch without requiring Adobe Acrobat, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.PDF for C++](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp)
 API that offers different features for PDF creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. Beside **create PDF C++** code, programmers can enhance and update code to create graphics, images and insert tables easily.

```cs
// Create document
auto new_pdf = MakeObject<Document>();
auto pages = new_pdf->get_Pages();
pages->Add();
// Numeration starts from 1
auto page = pages->idx_get(1);
auto paragraps = page->get_Paragraphs();
// Create text fragment
auto text = MakeObject<TextFragment>(u"Create PDF using C++ library");
auto ts = text->get_TextState();
// Set text state
ts->set_FontSize(16);
ts->set_FontStyle(FontStyles::Italic);
// Add to paragraph
paragraps->Add(text);
// Add text to paragraph
paragraps->Add(MakeObject<TextFragment>(u"PDF created using C++ code"));
// Save PDF file
new_pdf->Save(u"newlycreated.pdf");

// Developers can also create PDF via TextBuilder class to add text fragments and paragraphs
// as well as generate file with Images

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component.
