Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is free, platform-independent, international standard metafile format for storing and exchanging of vector graphics (2D), raster graphics, and text. CGM uses object-oriented approach and many function provisions for image production. CGM uses these object-oriented characteristics for remolding graphical elements to render an image. A metafile contains necessary information that defines other files. In CGM, a text based source file contains all graphical elements that can be later compiled into a binary file. Basically CGM is a way to facilitate 2D graphical data interchange, independent from any particular platform, or device.
