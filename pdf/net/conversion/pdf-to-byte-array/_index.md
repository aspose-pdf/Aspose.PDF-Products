```cs
// Initialize FileStream object
FileStream fs = new FileStream("source_file.pdf", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(fs);
long numBytes = new FileInfo("source_file.pdf").Length;

// Load the file contents in the byte array
byte[] buff = br.ReadBytes((int)numBytes);
fs.Close();
// Process the byte array as of your requirement
MemoryStream input_Stream = new MemoryStream(buff);
Aspose.Pdf.Document pdfDocument = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(input_Stream);
// Save data into image or in your required format

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component.
