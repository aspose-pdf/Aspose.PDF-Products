 As opposed to DOC, the DOCX file format is based on Open XML specifications. By default, Aspose.PDF saves the PDF in DOC format. It is also possible to save the PDF in DOCX format while setting the
 *DocSaveOptions.Format* 
 property.

*DocSaveOptions.Mode* 
 allows to specify the recognition mode for PDF content, whereas setting the mode to
 *RecognitionMode.Textbox* 
 is fast and good for preserving the original look of the PDF document. Every visually grouped block of text in the original PDF is converted into a Textbox while achieving maximum resemblance to the original PDF. However, since the resultant document entirely consists of Textboxes and it could make editing in Microsoft Word quite hard.

1.  Load a PDF via Document class constructor
1.  Create an instance of DocSaveOptions class for export
1.  Set DocSaveOptions.Mode property to DocSaveOptions.RecognitionMode.Flow
1.  Call Document.Save method with output file path

 Setting
 *DocSaveOptions.Mode* 
 to
 *DocSaveOptions.RecognitionMode.Flow* 
 allows the conversion engine perform grouping and multi-level analysis to restore the original document as per the authorвЂ™s intent while producing an easily editable document. However, the resultant Word document may look different from the original PDF.

Files with .doc extension represent documents generated by Microsoft Word or other word processing documents in binary file format. The extension was initially used for plain text documentation on several different operating systems. It can contain several different types of data such as images, formatted as well as plain text, graphs, charts, embedded objects, links, pages, page formatting, print settings and a lot others. The format was popular for all sorts of documentation due to the variety of options it offers to users for writing manuals, proposals, specifications, resumes, articles or any similar documents. The updated version of DOC is DOCX which is based on Office OpenXML whose specifications are openly available.

DOCX is a well-known format for Microsoft Word documents. Introduced from 2007 with the release of Microsoft Office 2007, the structure of this new Document format was changed from plain binary to a combination of XML and binary files. Docx files can be opened with Word 2007 and lateral versions but not with the earlier versions of MS Word which support DOC file extensions.
