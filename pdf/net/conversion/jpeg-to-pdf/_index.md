        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}
A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in the 1990s. A PDF file is a multi-platform document created by Adobe Acrobat or another PDF application. The PDF format is commonly used to save documents and publications in a standard format that can be viewed on multiple platforms, that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System.
PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features, and 3D objects in it that can become part of the source document.
