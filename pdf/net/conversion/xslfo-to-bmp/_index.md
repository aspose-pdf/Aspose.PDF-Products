 In order to convert XSLFO to BMP, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net)
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.pdf)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET developers can easily load & convert XSLFO files to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load XSLFO file with an instance of Document class
1. Create & set the instance of BmpDevice class with Size & Resolution
1. Call BmpDevice.Process method with page index & output file path as parameters

```cs
// Instantiate XslFoLoadOption object
var options = new XslFoLoadOptions("template.xslt")
{
    // Set error handling strategy
    ParsingErrorsHandlingType = XslFoLoadOptions.ParsingErrorsHandlingTypes.ThrowExceptionImmediately
};
// Create Document object
var document = new Aspose.Pdf.Document("template.xml", options);

// create an object of bmpDevice
var renderer = new Aspose.Pdf.Devices.BmpDevice();

// convert a particular page and save the image in BMP format
renderer.Process(document.Pages[1], "output.bmp");

XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a powerful stylesheet language for formatting XML documents. The semantics of the bounded form of paper and print are expressed by XSL-FO when the dimensions are fixed. In contrast to HTML, which represents the semantics of the unbounded form of a browser window with variable dimensions. The XML documents formatted by XSL-FO are mostly used to generate PDF files. XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is a set of feature complete W3C technologies intended to design for the formatting and exchange of XML documents and XSL-FO is a part of this language. XSLT and XPath are also other parts of XSL.

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
