 In order to convert TEX to JPEG, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.pdf) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET developers can easily load & convert TEX files to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load TEX file with an instance of Document class
1.  Create & set the instance of JpegDevice class with Size & Resolution
1.  Call JpegDevice.Process method with page index & output file path as parameters

```cs
// load TEX with an instance of Document
var document = new Document("template.tex");

// create an object of jpegDevice
var renderer = new Devices.JpegDevice();

// convert a particular page and save the image in JPEG format
renderer.Process(document.Pages[1], "output.jpeg");

TeX is a language that comprises of programming as well as mark-up features, used to typeset documents. Donald Knuth from Stanford University, is the creator of this resourceful typesetting system. Across the world, TeX is the ultimate choice of authors and publishers to produce high quality technical documents. TeX performs an outstanding job of formatting complex mathematical expressions. In conjunction with a high-quality phototypesetter, TeX competes the results generated by the best traditional typesetting systems. Therefore regarded as the classiest digital typographical systems.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
