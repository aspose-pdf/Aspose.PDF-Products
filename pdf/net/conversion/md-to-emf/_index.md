Text files created with Markdown language dialects is saved with .MD or .MARKDOWN file extension. MD files are saved in plain text format that uses Markdown language which also includes inline text symbols, defining how a text can be formatted such as indentations, table formatting, fonts, and headers.  MD files can be converted to HTML with a program called Markdown. Markdown language is released by John Gruber.

    {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}
Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
