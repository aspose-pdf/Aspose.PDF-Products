 PDF documents can have any number of pages therefore each page in PDF represents a Worksheet in Excel format after the conversion. It is possible to control the conversion by setting the boolean type
 *ExcelSaveOptions.MinimizeTheNumberOfWorksheets* 
 property to true. This ensures that all PDF pages are exported to single Worksheet of the resultant Excel file.
