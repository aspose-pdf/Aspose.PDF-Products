 A basicВ document merging and concatenatingВ with
 [Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net) 
 APIs can be done with justВ few lines of code.

+  Load all the CGM files with full path.
+  Make one document as the base file
+  Call the relevant method for concatenating and merging files one by one.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (CGM) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the CGM file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is free, platform-independent, international standard metafile format for storing and exchanging of vector graphics (2D), raster graphics, and text. CGM uses object-oriented approach and many function provisions for image production. CGM uses these object-oriented characteristics for remolding graphical elements to render an image. A metafile contains necessary information that defines other files. In CGM, a text based source file contains all graphical elements that can be later compiled into a binary file. Basically CGM is a way to facilitate 2D graphical data interchange, independent from any particular platform, or device. Read More
